# RAG Bot React Interface

A modern React application built with Vite and TypeScript for interacting with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot with intelligent conversation context management.

## Features

- **Smart Conversation Management**: Automatic context injection and memory management
- **Clean Chat Interface**: Modern, minimal design with glassmorphism effects
- **Dark Mode**: ChatGPT-inspired dark theme with smooth transitions
- **Source Citations**: Expandable source files and retrieved document snippets
- **Context Persistence**: Conversations maintain context across multiple questions
- **Conversation Reset**: Clear conversation history and start fresh
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and modern React patterns
- **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states, error handling, and typing indicators

## Backend Intelligence

The application leverages intelligent backend features for enhanced conversation quality:

- **Context Injection**: Backend automatically adds recent Q&A context to follow-up questions
- **Memory Management**: Keeps last 10 exchanges, auto-cleans older conversations  
- **Smart Prompting**: LLM sees both current question + conversation history
- **Fallback Handling**: Works seamlessly with or without conversation IDs
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Backend manages conversation lifecycle intelligently

## Getting Started

- Node.js (v20.19.0 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

Create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## API Integration

The app integrates with a backend API that provides intelligent conversation management:

### Main Endpoint: `/ask`
```json
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask
{
  "query": "Your question here",
  "conversation_id": "optional-conversation-id"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "The response text",
  "sources": ["file1.pdf", "file2.txt"],
  "retrieved_docs": ["Document content snippets..."],
  "conversation_id": "generated-or-existing-conversation-id"
}
```

### Clear Conversation: `/clear-conversation`
```json
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/clear-conversation
{
  "conversation_id": "conversation-id-to-clear"
}
```

### Frontend Responsibilities
- Store and manage conversation IDs in React state
- Send conversation IDs with each request for context continuity
- Update conversation IDs from backend responses
- Handle conversation clearing and reset

### Backend Intelligence
- Automatically injects recent Q&A context into follow-up questions
- Manages conversation memory (last 10 exchanges)
- Provides intelligent prompting with conversation history
- Handles conversation lifecycle and cleanup automatically
